I recommend control+F.

### General Terms

* Aggro - See Enmity
* Class - As class in other games, except in FFXIV combat classes are like your junior mode. You want to upgrade them to Jobs at level 30, which is really what you'll play in combat.
* Cleave - Any ability that is meant to deal damage on a single target but can also hit others nearby is a Cleave. When a boss cleaves it's typically a forward attack meant to punish non-tanks for being up front. So don't be in front! If someone asks you to cleave they mean to try to hit multiple enemies that are stacked up.
* DPS - Short for Damage Per Second. Can refer either to how much damage you're doing (e.g. "good dps!") or the DPS role, which is any job or class meant primarily for dealing damage.
* Enmity - Every enemy has a number representing how much they want to attack you. Every ability to use adds a tiny bit to this. Damage adds an amount equal to damage dealt. Healing is a bit more complex since it splits enmity between everything you're fighting. Highest number gets attacked by the enemy.
* Job - Basically a class, but is the upgraded version of the class. Not all jobs have a lower version, but all the starter classes must be upgraded to jobs later (level 30+) to reach your full potential.
* Limited Job - A special type of combat job that is not allowed to use standard duty finder or roulettes. They are also barred from some content entirely. What content they can queue into they must do so either undersized or with a full premade group. Meant more as a fun minigame than a serious job/class.
* Mob - Another word for enemy or monster.
* Snapshot - Every damaging ability checks how much damage it should deal at a very specific time, and it's usually not at the same time as you see the damage. That timing is the snapshot timing. Most enemy things snapshot when the orange circle disappears or when the cast ends, but it can vary.
* Stack - Means to have everyone tightly stacked together. Can also refer to a mechanic that asks you to stack together in order to split the damage.
* Threat - See Enmity.
