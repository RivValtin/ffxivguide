A list of various commonly-used telegraphs and what they mean.

### Gaze Attack

![Gaze attack example image](images/gaze_attack.png)

The eye symbol means that your character must be facing away from the monster when the attack activates or you will take some form of negative effect. They're usually something like paralysis, stun, petrify, or doom, and even in easier fights can easily kill you from the single mistake.

Remember, it is your _character_ that must face away, not your camera. Your character has a vision cone of approximately 90 degrees, maybe a touch more. The cone in the image is also 90 degrees to give you an example of what it looks like.

If a gaze attack also has an orange marker on the ground, that means you can avoid it either by turning away _or_ by being out of the orange marker. It is not necessary to do both. Other telegraphs combined with gaze attacks are just two separate effects happening at once, so in those cases you'll have to do both things (e.g. stack and look away).
