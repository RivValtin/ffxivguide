This guide will go over a large number of aspects of FFXIV combat, sometimes in excruciating detail. Do not feel compelled to fully read every section right away. 

Where relevant, the contents of these pages will only cover playing to maximize your team. There are cases where you can make choices that are better for your personal numbers, but worse for the team. I will not spend much time on such instances. The goal is to get the win, not to show off, though the two are often remarkably similar.

If you really want to maximize your game, I encourage you to check multiple guide sources and cross-compare them. If two guides disagree on how to handle something, experiment with it yourself to decide which seems better to you.

### Topics

* [Glossary](glossary.md) - Commonly used terms and what they mean. Will add to this over time.
* [Gear](gear.md) - What stats mean, where to get it, and so forth.
* [Hotbars](hotbars.md) - Advice on setting up your hotbar.
* [The Basics - Uptime and oGCDs](basics.md) (WIP, needs images)
* [Parses, and How to Read Them](parses.md) (not started)
* [Fight Telegraphs, and Common Mechanics](telegraphs.md) (WIP) - Common symbols used in various fights and what they mean.

* Addons/Mods - These are against terms of service and will break on patch day, somtimes staying broken for a week. Not advised, and also unnecessary. Parsing for personal use is a tenuous exemption. Never talk about any such tool in game in any way, parsing included (don't even mention DPS). That is the totality of my coverage on such things, except as present in the Parses page.

**Role-Specific Topics**
* Irrespective of role, you should try to understand what makes the other roles lives easier or harder and try to make their job as easy as you can. It's a team sport, so work together!
* [Tank Basics](tankbasics.md)
* [Healer Basics](healerbasics.md) (not started)
* [DPS Basics](dpsbasics.md) (not started)

### Class Guides

TODO. But I won't cover every class here, that's too much work for one person. Most likely I'll focus on the 1-2 I play the most at the time.

### Other References

Stuff not made/written by me, but that I felt was pretty good.

**Tools**
* [Etro](http://etro.gg) - A site for making and saving gear sets. Mostly used to create a theoretical perfect set for you to work towards. I find it easier to use than Ariyala, but YMMV.
* [Ariyala](https://ffxiv.ariyala.com/) - Another site for making and saving gear sets.
* [FF Logs](http://fflogs.com) - A place to upload battle logs made by ACT in order to be judged, as well as check statistics and leaderboards on various fights. (WARNING: Do not use any of this information to exclude/harass people; You can be banned for it. Use it for self-improvement _only_.)
* [XIV Analysis](https://xivanalysis.com/) - A tool for analysing your logs from fflogs to find ways to improve. Treat this as a flagging tool. That is to say, it will flag things that are _probably_ problems, but in some cases advanced players will see flags that they can safely ignore. You can use high-ranking public logs from others as a comparison point.
* [Garland Tools](https://garlandtools.org/) - A nice reference site, especially for the Garland Data section which lets you look up any item in the game, including currency, to see where it comes from and ways it can be used.

**Text Guides**
* [Clees Guides](https://clees.me/guides/) - Mostly for the UCoB and UWU ultimate guides, which are commonly referenced. Somewhat old guides, but still very valid.
* [Stat Breakpoint Tables](https://www.akhmorning.com/allagan-studies/stats/) - A reference sheet useful for advanced gear tweaking.

**Videos**

As a general rule, avoid relying on video guides for openers and rotations. In my experience such videos are often somewhat inaccurate, and it's not necessarily the author's fault as videos are much harder to update than text guides. 

* [A Crap Guide to Tanking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8oVV_I-tIA) - Despite the name and comedic tilt, actually good advice.
* [Momo's Healer Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WhrCpxtpQ8) - Has at least one tip that even the best healers I know didn't already know.
* [MTQ Capture](https://www.youtube.com/user/MTQcapture) - A channel with lots of fight guides. They are more succinct than most guides and come out fast, but as a consequence can contain some innaccuries or older, less-favored strategies.
